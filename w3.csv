Methods,"Section of a research article that describes the participants, procedure and materials used"
Results,Section of a research article that describes what was found; tables & graphs; statistics
Discussion,Section of a research article that compares content with past research and suggests practical applications
Introduction,Section of a research article that outlines the research questions; reviews past research and theory; introduces a formal hypothesis
Psychological construct,"Abstract psychological concept (e.g. aggression, intelligence, attractiveness)"
Operational construct,"Construct defined in terms of how it is to be measured (e.g. I.Q. score, # of dates, etc.)"
Independent Variable (IV),"The ""cause"" variable; naturally occurring in a correlational study; manipulated in an experiment"
Dependent Variable (DV),"The ""effect"" variable; depends on the independent variable (measured by the investigator)"
Confounding variable,"Variable closely associated with the independent variable (alternative ""cause"")"
Correlational Study,Investigates the relationship between two variables; studying naturally occurring groups; no random assignment
Experiments (Experimental Study),Investigate the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable; experimenter manipulates the IV and then observes that happens to the DV; random assignment of participants to one of two conditions
Temporal Precedence,Cause must precede effect
Covariation,Cause and effect must occur together
Alternative/ Confounding,Alternative/ confounding explanations must be eliminated
Statistics,Describing events mathematically
Descriptive Statistics,"Used to describe, summarize, and simplify a set of observations"
Inferential Statistics,Used to infer characteristics about the population from a sample
Variable,Observations with non-uniform values
Quantitative variables,"Numbers represent different quantities; more or less of an attribute (e.g. number of offspring, age, drug dosage)"
Qualitative variables,"Numbers represent different qualities; categories (e.g. sex, political affiliation, vehicle color)"
Population,The complete set of observations
Sample,A subset of observations taken to represent the population
Parameter,Describes characteristics of the population
Statistic,Describes corresponding characteristics of the sample
Sampling Error,The discrepancy observed between a sample statistic and its corresponding population parameter; varies from sample to sample
Median,Middle score; best measure if there are outliers (extreme scores)
Mean,Arithmetic mean; most frequently used to measure because sampling error is lowest
Mode,Most frequently observed sore; used for qualitative data
Range,Difference between the highest score and the lowest score
Variance,Average amount of squared deviation from the arithmetic mean
Standard Deviation,Average amount of deviation from the arithmetic mean
Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient - r,"Describes the relationship between two variables (i.e. direction of the relationship - pos or neg, magnitude of relationship)"
Default assumption,Observed difference is due to sampling error
Statistically significant,Probability that the observed difference is due to sampling error is very low
Non statistically significant,"Probability that the observed difference is due to sampling error is high; therefore, not enough evidence to conclude that treatment caused the difference"
