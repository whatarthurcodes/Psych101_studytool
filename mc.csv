Cognitive vs physical tasks,Every tasks has cognitive and physical aspects;
,Human factors is cog erg; Ergo is physical ergo;
,
Lec 2: Senses and Perception,
Sensation,"From physical ener or substance to neural signal; automatic, almost no attention needed"
Perception,From neural signals to meaningful mental representations; affected by individual exp
Cones,"Concentrated in fovea(sensitive to high freq, center of retina); less sensitive to motion; fine detail high rez"
Rods,"onlyoccur only in the periphery(good for night vision)! Sensitive to motion, coarse low rez"
SSTS,"Short term sensory storage; vision, called iconic memo, brief (<1000ms), high capacity)"
Motion parallax,"Relative motion (visual depth perception); monocular cues, observer centered; app, object further away moves slower than objs close by"
Binocular disparity,1. two eyes see two diff imgs (e.g. 3D movies using polarized glass)
,
Convergence,Rotation of two eyes in their sockets to focus on a single object
Works with 1 eye (Monocular cues),"Linear perspective, relative size, overlap, aerial perspective, motion parallax; accommodation"
Require 2 eyes,"Binocular disparity, convergence"
,
Lec 3: Sesnes and Perception II,
Auditory,"Sense of sound; intensity in dB, frequency 2-20k Hz, 0-130 dB human audible range; (freq to pitch and loudness; intensity to loudness)"

Affordance,- Perceived functions of an obj (based on exp and expectancies)
,- inform the opportunity to perform an action (e.g. door push handle)
Gestalt principles,The mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies
Perception: constancy,"Size, shape, brightness, color"
Perception: illusion,"Brain tries to make sense of what eyes are telling it; but not correctly interpret the truth( apps: art, building design"
McGurk Effect,A perceptual phenomenon: demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception(ppl rely more on lip-reading)
Absolute threshold,"The lowest level at which a stimulus can be detected, for 50% of time"
Differential threshold,"The level at which an increase in a detected stimulus can be detected, 50% of tiem"
Just noticeable difference,"Changes with the absolute val; ppl better at telling diff rather than abz val (e.g. weight compare, brightness, and temperature, all relative)"
Sensation and perception chars and apps,"- all necessary info well above absolute threshold; - make unnecessary stimuli not sensible; - want to rank multiple options, compare 2 at a time; - use machines to enhance sensation(e.g. infrared, night vision)"
Adaptation,Dark adaptation: bright to darker env;
,Light adaptation: dark to bright env
,"Red is best for protecting night vision, rods most sensitive"
,
Lec 4: Attention,
Meaning of attention,Academic: limited mental resources needed in various stages of cognitive processing
,"Acronyms: notice, awareness, observation, contemplation"
Chars of attention,"Selective, focus, divided, sustained (not 4 kinds of attention resouces, but 4 ways use our attention resources) all require mental effort and contribute to feeling of mental workload, and accumulation of fatigue"
Selective,"Large amount of sensory ipt, limited attention resouces; only process selective ones; filter metaphor, spotlight metaphor"
Covert/ Overt,Visual attention shift != eye movement; covert attention shift: no eye move; overt: eyes move and any physical orienting of body
Focused,"Other side of selective, ignore sensory info not selected; suppress distracters; difficult when distraction is attention-capturing(e.g. gf chat)"
Divided,Attend multiple objs at same time; multi-tasking
Sustained attention,"Maintain vigilance, focused on task for prolonged time;"
,"- LD driving, system monitoring"
SEEV model,"Model explains factors that affect AOI, time spent looking at each AOI, probability to notice unexpected events"

,Major causes: selective and focused attention
,Attention narrowing or tunneling: attention focused on AOIs with expected high vals/importance
,- unexpected events from unexpected AOIs
Visual search,"Limited attention,"
,Useful field of view(UFOV): the visual angle within which a target can be detected if present;
Parallel/ Serial Search,Parl: targets stands out from others;
