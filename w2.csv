Learning,Relatively permanent change in behavior that occurs because of experience
Behaviorism,"Behavior can be studied without referring to mental studies (i.e. classical conditioning, operant conditioning, observational learning & imitation)"
Social-Cognitive Learning,Reintroduced mental process into investigating learning
Classical Conditioning,Learning that results from associations of neutral environmental stimuli with automatic responses
Unconditioned Stimulus (US),Stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in the absence of learning
Unconditioned Response (UR),Reflexive response elicited by a stimulus in the absence of learning
Conditioned Stimulus (CS),Initially neutral stimulus comes to elicit conditioned response
Conditioned Response (CR),Reflexive response elicited by the conditional stimulus
Higher-Order Conditioning,Neutral stimulus can become a CS by repeatedly pairing it with another CS (note: CS = conditioned stimulus)
Stimulus Generalization (for classical conditioning),Conditioned reflex can be generalized to similar neutral stimuli
Stimulus Discrimination (for classical conditioning),Conditioned reflex might not be generalized to similar neutral stimuli that fail to predict US (unconditioned stimulus)
Irrational fear,Neutral stimulus associated with negative emotion
Counter-conditioning,Phobias may be reduced by pairing fearful stimulus with objects associated with positive emotions
Basic,"Accumulation of knowledge for knowledge sake (describe, predict & explain behavior)"
Applied,Application of knowledge to solve practical problems (modify behavior)
Operant conditioning,Particular responses increase or decrease depending on their consequences (voluntary behavior)
Law of Effect,"Behaviors that lead to ""satisfying"" results are ""stamped in"" whereas those that lead to ""unsatisfying"" results are ""stamped out"""
Radical Behaviorism,"Rejected use of ""satisfying"" or ""unsatisfying"" as explanations for behavior"
Reinforcement,Stimulus increases the response that follows (note: there are primary & secondary reinforcers)
Primary reinforcers,Inherently reinforce the response and typically satisfy a physiological need (food); deprived state
Secondary reinforcers,Acquired reinforcing qualities through association with other reinforcers (money)
Punishment,Stimulus decreases the response that it follows (note: there are primary & secondary punishers)
Primary punishers,Stimuli that are inherently punishing (pain)
Secondary punishers,Acquired punishing properties through association with other punishers (fine)
Neutral consequences,No effect on response
Stimulus Generalization (for operant conditioning),Tendency for a response that has been reinforced in the presence of one stimulus to occur in the presence of other similar stimuli
Stimulus Discrimination (for operant conditioning),Tendency for response to occur in the presence of one stimulus but not in the presence of other similar stimuli
Continuous schedule,Response is always reinforced; leads to faster learning; faster extinction
Intermittent (partial) schedule,Reponses is sometimes reinforced; slower learning but more resistant to extinction
Fixed-ratio schedule,Reinforcement occurs after fixed number of responses (e.g. quotas)
Variable-ratio schedule,Reinforcement occurs after some average number of responses (e.g. slot machines)
Extrinsic reinforcers,Originate outside the individual and not inherently related to the activity being reinforced (e.g. money)
Intrinsic reinforcers,Originate inside the individual and inherently related to activity being reinforced (i.e. pride of accomplishment)
